Welcome to Zen Fisher!
I found you out by the lake over in the Grassy Biome, where did you come from?
* [The woods]
* [Outer space]
* [Your mom]
- Anyways, if you're gonna live here, you're gonna have to catch your share of fish.
- I have a spare rod in the barrel over there, why don't you try and have a go at it?
